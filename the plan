each application is stored in the applications folder under its own folder

each has at least

-app.jsapp

app.js exports these four functions:

#command

command will be passed the calling users data store for that plugin and the message, along with node command parser

#configPage

will expect to return HTML.

#getRedirect (object containing .params and .userId, res)

handler for get requests to its directory.

#postRedirect (object containing .body and .userId, res)

handler for post requests to its directory.


if data store is needed, mongoose is available. a model javascript file should be included in the application directory.

potentially could develop a standard set of tests????

RIGHT NOW
----
website should be able to

send commands to the server
view all commands
view all users plugins
view all plugins and add them (don't show users plugins here)


so we need

command input at the top

Commands tab
Your Plugins tab
Add Plugins tab

{
    "message": "Client registered. Please save your _id and secret.",
    "data": {
        "__v": 0,
        "user_id": "54a1fa8b5d842f2a7a455ab2",
