each application is stored in the applications folder under its own folder

each has at least

-app.jsapp

app.js exports these four functions:

#command

command will be passed the calling users data store for that plugin and the message, along with node command parser

#configPage

will expect to return HTML.

#get(object containing .params and .userId, res)

handler for get requests to its directory.

#post(object containing .body and .userId, res)

handler for post requests to its directory.


if data store is needed, mongoose is available. a model javascript file should be included in the application directory.
