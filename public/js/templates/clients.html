  <p>There is only one client right now: a terminal application written in Python. It should work in all Unix environments.</p>
  <p><h3>Download here: <a href="/clients/cmnd">cmnd terminal client</a></h3></p>
  <p><strong>Installation instructions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      tldr, in the same folder as cmnd:<br>
      <strong>chmod 755 cmnd<br>cp cmnd /usr/local/bin<br>cmnd setup</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Explanation:</li>
    <li>Make the script executable: <strong>chmod 755 cmnd</strong></li>
    <li>Copy it to /usr/local/bin so it is executable anywhere: <strong>cp cmnd /usr/local/bin</strong></li>
    <li>Run <strong>cmnd setup</strong> to authenticate with cmnd's server.</li>
    <li>That's it. Try running a few commands, if you've added an application.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the future, hopefully, maybe, SDKs will be released for developing clients as well as applications.</p>
